MultiTracker is a test program accompanying Multimaterial Mesh-Based Surface 
Tracking, Da, F., Batty, C., and Grinspun, E. 2014, ACM Trans. on Graphics 
(SIGGRAPH 2014), including the multimaterial mesh-based surface tracking
library LosTopo.

CMake files for building are out of date - sorry!

The following external libraries are required:

Eigen (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)
OpenGL and GLUT (http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/)

Running the executables without command line arguments will display usage
information. All the data files for testing are located in the assets folder.

New: No more dependency on LAPACK! (uses Eigen functionality instead)
